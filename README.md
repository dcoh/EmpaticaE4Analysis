# EmpaticaE4Analysis

Assisting a PhD student with a project analyzing data streams gathered from an empatica E4 band.  Because of the large quantity of data I will be helping her clean and organize it, as well as potentially creating a library for other students in her lab to clean and organize future data gathered by the Empatica E4 bands that they use.

Various XYZ_output.ipynb files are labeled with the data that they attempt to clean and organize
